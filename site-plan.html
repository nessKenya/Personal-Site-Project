      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I'm a freelance web designer. I help businesses leverage online presence by designing them with a professional, user-friendly, and brand unique website. I have experience in WordPress, Joomla, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Search Engine Optimization that is essential in providing websites that help companies to reach out to their potential customers. I have worked with individuals and companies in helping them target the ever-increasing online market. In creating a website, I not only give the company an online presence, but I also increase their marketability and revenue by a significant amount.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My services target all kinds of businesses. The world is ever changing and each day, the majority of the potential clients spent much of their time browsing the internet. In the words of Bill Gates, "If your business is not on the internet, then your business will be out of business." This statement is true today than ever with Corona Virus affecting businesses largely. I design websites for small medium businesses to large corporations, giving them a voice among the internet users. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

        Style Guide
      </h2>

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/f9f9f9-3c1874-f1b24a-0e0b16-ffffff" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/f9f9f9-3c1874-f1b24a-0e0b16-ffffff</a>


      <table class="colors">
        <tr><th>Primary</th><th>Secondary</th><th>Accent 1</th><th>Accent 2</th></tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr><td class="primary">[#F9F9F9]</td><td class="secondary">[#0E0B16]</td><td class="accent1">[#F1B24A]</td><td class="accent2">[#3C1874]</td></tr>
      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Montserrat, Verdana, Open Sans  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I am making a portfolio. Montserrat is quite readable and eye catching for those visiting the site to easily see it standing out. I have Verdana and Open Sans as the fall back fonts in the event that the browser doesn't support the Google fonts in use.<!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Roboto, Raleway, Helvetica, Sans-Serif  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        Roboto is good for paragraphs as it is well spaced out, readable and has good line height naturally. It makes the content under individual headlines to stand out for a portfolio. I have also web safe fonts for fall back. <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs.  Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and experienced rafters.  No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it happen for you. 
      </p>
